# Bugs

Bugs are small, mischievous creatures that cause problems in the Land of Code. They come in all shapes and sizes, and each one has its own unique abilities. Some bugs move fast, some slow, some jump, and some fly. Some bugs are shy and hide in the shadows, while others are bold and like to show off.

Face off against GitHub bugs in turn-based battles reminiscent of classic Pok√©mon games.

Each bug represents a common coding challenge:

* Syntax Errors (type: Logic)
* Segmentation Faults (type: Memory)
* Security Vulnerabilities (type: Exploit)
* Merge Conflicts (type: Collaboration)
* etc.

And each bug type has strengths and weaknesses:

* Logic: Strong against Memory, weak against Exploit.
* Memory: Strong against Collaboration, weak against Logic.
* Exploit: Strong against Logic, weak against Collaboration.
* Collaboration: Strong against Exploit, weak against Memory.
* etc.

Use type advantages strategically to fight (or as we say, **debug**) efficiently.
