# Companions

Joining you on this coding adventure are your local companions. They're here to help you, guide you, and cheer you on as you explore the Land of Code and tackle challenges along the way.

Each companion has its own personality and skills:

* **The Octocat**: Clever, curious, and great at staying organized, Mona keeps the team on track. Mona can summon Git Powers to track and revert errors, etc.

* **The Rubber Duck**: A great listener who helps you think things through and come up with solutions. It provides clarity by helping “talk through” problems, stunning bugs or exposing weaknesses, etc.

* **Copilot**: Your AI companion who offers smart suggestions and knows just the trick to tackle tough challenges. Copilot analyzes the battle and generates optimized “patches” or attack suggestions, etc.
