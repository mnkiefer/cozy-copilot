# Cozy Copilot

## Welcome to the Land of Code! ðŸ‘‹

The Land of Code is a bright, exciting place full of creativity and possibilities. It's where people build amazing things - games, apps, and programs that connect the world around us.

But lately, things have been a little off... Mischievous [Bugs](./docs/Bugs.md) have started causing trouble, making systems crash and projects glitch. Thatâ€™s where you come in! With big dreams and ideas, plus a certain knack for solving problems, you'll set out on an adventure with your loyal [Mascots](./docs/Mascots.md) to explore the Land of Code, battle (or as we say, *fix*) the bugs, and make everything run smoothly again.

Along the way, you'll meet new friends, discover hidden treasures, and unlock your full potential as a future developer.

Ready to get started?
